Tomato Hunt:


Having seen others benefit and personally benefiting from the “pomodoro method” (25 min timed productive sessions paired with 5 min breaks), I dedicated a page to enhance user accessibility and experience. Written in JS, HTML, and CSS, the page rewards users in “tomato currency” for every 25 minute session finished. The tomatoes can be cashed in for breaks. Using gamification, the page helps users enjoy being productive.
